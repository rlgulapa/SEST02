    <h1>ACTIVITY 3: Guess the Secret Number</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>Open your JavaScript development environment or console.</li>
      <li>
        Declare a variable named secretNumber and assign it a random integer
        between 1 and 10.
      </li>
      <li>
        Declare a variable named attempts and set it to 0. This variable will
        keep track of the number of attempts made by the player.
      </li>
      <li>
        Declare a variable named guessedNumber to store the player's guesses.
      </li>
      <li>Display a welcome message to the player using console.log().</li>
      <li>
        Start a do-while loop to repeatedly ask the player for their guess until
        they guess the correct number.
      </li>
      <li>
        Inside the loop, prompt the player to enter their guess using prompt()
        function and store it in the guessedNumber variable.
      </li>
      <li>
        Use an if statement to check if the guessedNumber is lower than the
        secretNumber.
        <ol>
          <li>
            If it is lower, display the message "Too low! Try again." using
            console.log().
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        Use an else if statement to check if the guessedNumber is higher than
        the secretNumber.
        <ol>
          <li>
            If it is higher, display the message "Too high! Try again." using
            console.log().
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        Use an else statement to handle the case when the guessedNumber matches
        the secretNumber.
        <ol>
          <li>
            Display the message "Congratulations! You guessed the correct
            number: [secretNumber]" using console.log().
          </li>
          <li>
            Display the message "It took you [attempts] attempts." to let the
            player know how many attempts they took.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Increment the attempts variable by 1.</li>
      <li>
        Repeat steps 7-11 until the guessedNumber matches the secretNumber.
      </li>
      <li>End the game.</li>
    </ol>

      let secretNumber = 7;
      let attempts = 1;
      let guessedNumber;
      console.log("Welcome, player.");
      do {
        guessedNumber = prompt("Please guess a number between 1-10", 2);
        // guessedNumber = 7;
        if (guessedNumber < secretNumber) {
          console.log("Too low! Try again.");
        } else if (guessedNumber > secretNumber) {
          console.log("Too high! Try again.");
        }
        if (guessedNumber != null && guessedNumber == secretNumber) {
          console.log("Congratulations! You guessed the correct number: 7");
