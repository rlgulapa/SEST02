    <h1>ACTIVITY 1: Grade Calculator</h1>
    <p>
      In this activity, the user is prompted to enter a score. Based on the
      score entered, the code uses conditional statements (if, else if, and
      else) to determine the corresponding grade.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>If the score is 90 or above, it assigns the grade 'A'.</li>
      <li>If the score is between 80 and 89, it assigns the grade 'B'.</li>
      <li>If the score is between 70 and 79, it assigns the grade 'C'.</li>
      <li>If the score is between 60 and 69, it assigns the grade 'D'.</li>
      <li>Otherwise, if the score is below 60, it assigns the grade 'F'.</li>
      <li>The grade is then printed to the console.</li>
    </ul>

      function getGrade(score) {
        let grade = "F";
        if (score >= 90 && score <= 100) grade = "A";
        else if (score >= 80 && score <= 89) grade = "B";
        else if (score >= 70 && score <= 79) grade = "C";
        else if (score >= 60 && score <= 69) grade = "D";
        else if (score >= 0 && score <= 59) grade = "F";
        else grade = "invalid score";
