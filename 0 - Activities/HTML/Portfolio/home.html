            <span><strong>Bio :</strong></span> I’m a passionate and
            results-driven Full Stack Web Developer with over 5 years of
            experience in building scalable and dynamic websites and web
            applications. I specialize in creating user-friendly,
            performance-optimized solutions that solve real-world problems. From
            front-end design to back-end architecture, I enjoy every aspect of
            the development process. My expertise spans modern web technologies,
            including HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (React, Node.js), and SQL/NoSQL
            databases (PostgreSQL, MongoDB). I also have experience with cloud
            platforms (AWS, Azure) and deploying apps using Docker and CI/CD
            pipelines. I thrive in collaborative, agile environments and am
            always excited to learn about new technologies and frameworks to
            stay ahead in the fast-paced world of web development.
