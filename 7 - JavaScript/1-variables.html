    <h1>JavaScript Key Points</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Statements:</strong> JavaScript code is composed of statements
        that perform specific actions. Each statement typically ends with a
        semicolon (;), although it is not always required.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Comments: </strong> You can add comments in JavaScript to
        provide explanations or make notes within the code. There are two types
        of comments: single-line comments, starting with //, and multi-line
        comments, enclosed between /* and */.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Case sensitivity</strong> JavaScript is case-sensitive, meaning
        that uppercase and lowercase letters are treated differently. For
        example, "variable" and "Variable" would be considered as two separate
        variables.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Whitespace</strong> JavaScript ignores spaces, tabs, and line
        breaks (collectively called whitespace) that are not necessary for code
        execution. However, whitespace can enhance code readability.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Blocks: </strong> Code blocks in JavaScript are enclosed in
        curly braces ({}) and are used to group statements together. Blocks are
        often used in control structures like loops and conditional statements.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <script>
      console.log("Hello World!");
      // This is a single-line comment.
      /* This is a 
      multi-line
      comment */

      // Camel Case Naming Convention
      // Variables
      // var - mutable/changeable
      var firstName = "John";
      console.log("Firstname:", firstName);

      // Variables
      // var - mutable/changeable
      var firstName = "John";
      console.log("Firstname:", firstName);
      firstName = "Jane";
      console.log("Firstname:", firstName);

      let lastName = "Doe";
      console.log("Lastname:", lastName);
      lastName = "Smith";
      console.log("Lastname:", lastName);

      // {} - Code Block
      {
        var email = "janesmith30@example.com";
        let username = "janesmith30";
        console.log("Email:", email);
        console.log("Username:", username);
      }
      console.log("Email:", email);
      // console.log("Username:", username); ReferenceError: username is not defined

      const birthday = "02-14-2000";
      console.log("Birthday:", birthday);
      // birthday = "02-15-20vvvvvvvvvvvvvv00"; TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.

      // {} - Code Block
      {
        var email = "janesmith30@example.com";
        let username = "janesmith30";
        const pi = 3.14;
        console.log("Email:", email);
        console.log("Username:", username);
        console.log("Pi:", pi);
      }
      console.log("Email:", email);
      // console.log("Username:", username); ReferenceError: username is not defined
      // console.log("Pi:", pi); ReferenceError: username is not defined
